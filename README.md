While learning about cybersecurity and online business, I also go play basketball in pro basketball runs I get invited to, while also lift and exercising to stay in shape. 
## Websites I recommend
* [Exercising](https://www.juddlienhard.com) this is what app I use to workout and it also has a community of people who also use the app to so you don’t feel alone and can ask/ talk about anything on there. 
* [Cybersecurity](https://www.isc2.org) This website is where I will be getting my cybersecurity certification to start off my career in IT while going to school here
